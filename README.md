# Peere review for neakovalainen
The application is nice! The amount of tables is suffiecient and i can run the application without any problems. I liked that you added a random feature simulator whenever someone is leaving a post on your website!

You could add some more admin functionalities but that's just a preference question. 
Also you could add an extra popup whenever someone is trying to delete a post. For extra caution. Like "Are you sure you want to delete this post?"

Good job!!
